 This application implements a Basic Logic Gate Simulator. The application consists of panel and a grid. The panel allows the user to select input and output controls and a range of logic gates to be displayed on a grid. On selecting a gate, another windows pops up which asks the user to select the number of inputs (2 or 3) for that particular gate and displays the gate with desired number of inputs on the grid. More functionality to be added...
