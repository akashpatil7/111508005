Project: Logic Gate Simulator
Name: Akash Patil
MIS: 111508005
 
This application implements a Basic Logic Gate Simulator. 
The application consists of panel, grid and menu bar. The panel allows the user to select input and output controls and a range of logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) to be displayed on a grid. On selecting a gate, another windows pops up which asks the user to select the number of inputs (2,3 or 4) for that particular gate and displays the gate with desired number of inputs on the grid. The 'New' option in the 'File' option in the Menu bar clears the grid to start with a new circuit and the 'Exit' option closes the application. More functionality to be added...
